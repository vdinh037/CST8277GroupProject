# CST8277GroupProject
CST8277GroupProject

As a group you are to create a JEE project, with REST web services, patterned after the ‘DemoStuff’
demonstrations from lecture, using Tuna’s as seen in Assignments 1 through 3.
o Tip: Generate UUID value for each instance of the Tuna Entity inside its constructor.
• You can create this project on one person’s computer then share the project, or create it individually, but
ensure everyone has the exact same settings and configurations so that the development of clients will be
easier towards the end of the project. i.e. If students A and B have setup the JEE server app and configurations,
and A creates the Swing client, and B creates the Android client, both clients should work against either
Student A’s or Student B’s JEE Server Application, if they don’t you will lose marks during the demonstration.
• Important: Use a project root like C:\CST8277GroupProject when you create your NetBeans projects to make
it easier to move the projects from one computer to another.
• As a group you are to also create one of each type of client, as per the ‘DemoStuff’ handouts in lecture:
Console with CORBA, Swing with CORBA, JavaFX with CORBA, JavaFX with REST, Android with REST, JEE Test
REST Website.
• As a group demonstrate all of this, on one computer, in week 14 of the course, in your lab period.
o Example:
▪ Run the JEE Application, insert a record via the web interface and show all records
▪ Run the NetBeans test REST project and test by showing all records (1 REST client)
▪ Run the CORBA clients, each one inserting one record, and showing all records (3 CORBA Clients)
▪ Run the REST clients, each one displaying all the records (2 more REST clients)
▪ The clients must communicate with CORBA or REST (respectfully) to the JEE Enterprise Beans /
REST web service on GlassFish. (i.e. the clients are not permitted to connect directly to the
database, and the GlassFish 5 application server must be used with a JEE project).
• If you are absent from the presentation you will be awarded a score of zero for the entire group project.
o Exceptional circumstances excluded, e.g. sickness, death in family, birth in family, work matter (etc.)
contact your professor promptly if something happens that prevents you from being present for the group
demonstration in the lab period in week 14.
• As a group create the requested documentation as part of your submission.
